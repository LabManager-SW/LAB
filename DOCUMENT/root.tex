\begin{abstract}

Lab Experiment Subject Management Hybrid Applicaion (LESM) provides online community where laboratories can post their experiment subject recruitment notices. For the people who are hoping to participate as a subject in a experiment, they can simply find and search for experiments that are suitable and apply for them. 
Using Clinical Subject Management(LESM), laboratories can easily find people they need for experiment and collect sufficient data from experiments. For applicants, they can earn a substantial amount of allowance that laboratories pay for them. Additionally, LESM offers data management service for laboratories. They can figure out their experiment schedule at a glance. Subjects' information will be saved at database server so that laboratories can find a specific data with key information of subjects. By using LESM, laboratories will be able to handle bunch of experiment schedule and result data in a well organized form.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\maketitle{\textbf{Motivation\\}}

Because there was no platform that allows communication between laboratories and people, it is hard for laboratories researcher to find clinical subjects. Previously, they had to find subjects through personal ways. For example, they had to make a recruitment notice to print out and post or to upload at small websites. They also had to receive text and reply one by one with their own phone. And researchers had to put all the information about each applicants and schedules from text messages to excel file. So we decided to create a platform that allows the lab to post recruitment notice and students to look at it and apply for what they want. And Because there were no such things that manage their experimental data, we add one more thing in our app. A simple database system. Researchers can keep their test result or subjects’ personal data efficiently. There are a lot of data that researchers want to review afterwards. Since bunch of data are accumulated steadily, they frequently have difficulty finding out the specific information they need without systematic database. By saving all the data related to experiments, it will be a lot easier to handle and search for it. \\

\subsection{Data Transaction\\}

\subsubsection{Previous Way Of Data Transaction}
Applicants provide their personal information via \textbf{text message or e-mail.} 
Researchers save the information in the format of \textbf{excel}. In worse cases,it is saved at their \textbf{phone contact list}\textbf{ or .txt file}.\\
Researchers provide information about experiments via recruitment notice posted at \textbf{school online community} or at \textbf{bulletin board in school buildings}. Applicants have very limited way of obtaining this information because the preferred posting location is different among diverse laboratories. This means that recruitment notices are dispersed. Also, they usually save the experiment information \textbf{by taking a picture or screen shot of the notices.}
Experiment result data is saved at \textbf{researchers personal PC} in the format of excel, .bdf, .mat or word.\\

\subsubsection{\textbf{Data That Applicants Need From Researcher}\\}
\begin{itemize}
\item Name Of Experiment
\item Main Purpose Of Experiment
\item Location
\item Date and Time 
\item Expected Duration Time
\item Specific Process Of Experiment
\item Payment
\item Condition For The Adequate Subjects\\
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{\textbf{Data That Researchers Need From Applicants\\}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Name
\item Age
\item Sex
\item E-mail Address
\item Contact Number
\item Possible Date and Time\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Result Data That Researchers Get After Experiment\\} }
\begin{itemize}
\item Raw data such as .bdf and .mat
\item Result data of raw data analysis. Such as excel and doc.
\item Special features for each of subjects.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Data That Researchers Upload To DB\\}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Result data of experiment
\item Name of Lab
\item Experiment types that are held in the lab
\item Name of University(Location)
\item Contact number 
\item Email address
\item Special features for each of subjects
\item Schedule of experiments.
\item Detailed information of experiments for applicants.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Data That Database Return To Researchers\\} }
\begin{itemize}
\item Subjects personal information who have previously participated
\item Scheduled experiment date
\item Experiment date records
\item Result data of experiment\\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Transaction Efficiency\\}
\subsubsection{Inefficiency of Data Transaction\\}
    Fundamentally, the inefficiency is caused by lack of database system between applicants and researchers. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The recruitment notices are dispersed. Some are posted online and others are printed out to be posted in bulletin board. Like this, there are a number of recruitment notices which are huge volume of data required by people who hope to apply as subject. This inefficiency problem arises since there is no platform that contains these data at a systemized database. Researchers cannot deliver the notice to potential applicants and applicants have no other way but to wander around online community and bulletin board to get the notice information.
    \item When applicants send their personal information via text message or e-mail, researchers have to copy all the information to excel or .txt file by himself. They also have to save the contact number of applicants in their phone since they need to keep in contact for organizing experiment date and time or to discuss about payment. 
    \item Researchers have to handle bunch of data related to experiments. It includes information of applicants and experiment result or date. Researchers do have their on way of organizing and saving these data but it is inefficient without database server. They usually save the data at local drive with custom folder. Then they inevitably have to memorize the folder location, name and the type of data saved in it.  
\end{itemize}

\section{REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS\\}


\subsection{Account Management}
\subsubsection{Separate Account Data}
There are two types of users. The lab researchers and applicants for experiments. For each of the user, different front page will be shown that contains different functions. At the very first page, users have to choose whether they are lab researchers or applicants. 
\subsubsection{Sign Up}
For the lab researcher member, it is required to register the lab and his or her e-mail address. Just a one account will be assigned to a lob. For the applicants, they have to enter their e-mail address, name and phone number. This information will be delivered to researchers who manage the experiment that the applicant applies. 
\subsubsection{Log In}
After clicking the check box whether they are lab researchers or applicants at the very first page, log in page will be shown. Users can sign in with their e-mail address and password. Buttons for password will be provided.


\subsection{Functions For Lab}

\subsubsection{Main Page}
The experiment schedule of the lab will be shown in the form of calender. Also, the list of experiment instances will be shown with check box. There is another list that shows all the researcher registered in that lab. The general manger has authority with this list. There are four buttons one for creating new experiment instance, another for searching the previous data of specific experiment, another for posting recruitment notice and the other for uploading/revising experiment result data. 
After checking one of the check boxes at the list of experiment instances, it is possible to click one of the last three buttons. 
\subsubsection{Experiment Data Query}
If a researcher selects one of the experiments in the list and click the searching button at the main page, the page of querying for that experiment data will be shown. The user can easily search for specific experiment data according to the name of subjects, date, the researcher in charge and the objective of the experiment. 
\subsubsection{Uploading/Revising Experiment Result Data}
If a researcher selects one of the experiments in the list and click this button at the main page, the page of uploading and revising for the experiment result data will be shown. The researcher in charge can enter the date,time, explanatory comment, name and other special features of the subject. It is also possible to request for personal information like age and gender. 
\subsubsection{Create Experiment Instance}
After clicking the button for creation of new experiment instance at the main page, pop-up for entering specific information of the new experiment will be shown. Only the general manager can use this function. The name of the researcher in charge, experiment objective and the name and type of the experiment should be entered. 
\subsubsection{Posting the Recruitment Notice}
After clicking the button for posting recruitment notice at the main page, the researcher in charge moves to the next page. In this page, the researcher should make the schedule of the experiment date and time via calender UI. Then the researcher should enter the specific information like the payment, condition, the method of experiment, place of the laboratory, expected duration time. The notice form delivered to the applicants page will automatically include these details in addition to name of the experiment, name of the researcher in charge, date and time. This notice form will be loaded to the applicants' main page.

\subsection{Functions For Applicants}
\subsubsection{Main Page}
In this page, users can see the list of recruitment notices in a similar form like Albamon bulletin board. They can search specific experiment by setting conditions like the type,payment and date. Then the list will be organized in order of payment and deadline.
\subsubsection{Detail Information Page}
If users click one of the recruitment notices, they move to the next page which contains details of the experiment. It shows the information that are entered by the researcher in charge. Additionally, there is a calender combined with check box. Each date box in the calendar might contain the time of experiment that researcher has scheduled and posted at previous stage. Small message boxes are attached to each of the scheduled date which indicate whether another applicant has already applied for it or not. The applicants can only click the check boxes of the date that no other applicants have applied for. The applicant should first check one of the check boxes and click apply button. This apply button will show pop-up with the message of "successfully applied". Also, as soon as the button is clicked, the message box of that date should be changed to indicate that there is no opening.
\subsubsection{My Page}
In the main page, users can move to MyPage by clicking the button of 'MyPage'. In this page, they can see a list which contains all the experiments that they have applied for. They can see the brief information such as the name of experiment, location, contact number of researcher and the date they have participated or scheduled to participate. On the left side of each element, there are check boxes. If users want to cancel some of the experiments,they should click the check boxes and then click the 'cancel' button. If they want to see the whole detailed information about a experiment, they should click a element in the list. Then they can move on to the information page.
\subsubsection{Information Page For Experiments In MyPage}
This page will contain all the information of the experiment that has been previously shown when applicants were applying for it. This will fulfill the need that applicants want to review the specific detail of the experiments again.


\subsection{Communication Between Applicants and Lab}
\subsubsection{Message Drop Box}
If applicant wants to reschedule or make inquiries, sending direct message will be useful. With this service, the researchers do not need to reply with their own phone or e-mail. 
\subsubsection{Communication page for Lab}
This page shows the list of scheduled experiments. The elements can be divided according to whether there are applicants or not. There is pop-up notice that tell them every time someone apply for the experiment. Also, there is drop box which contain all the inquiry messages from applicant and reply to them. 
\subsubsection{Communication page for Applicants}
After clicking the inquiry message button at the page of detailed information, pop-up will be shown to enter inquiry message. This message will be saved in the account's drop box. 


\section{\\DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT}
\subsection{Choice of software development platform}

\maketitle{\textit{Form of application: Hybrid Application}}

We were trying to create an application only. However, we figured out that the application alone is not sufficient for users and the laboratory to write and post a notice. To be specific, the main problem is that the data file which the lab researchers handle is not a simple task. In most cases, the file format is .bdf and .mat. These data files are usually stored at the desktop computer in the lab. If we create mobile application, it will be difficult to deliver the file from local desktop to the server. Additionally, there are a lot of things to type in when posting a notice, entering personal information and so on. Therefore, we decided to make a hybrid application. We will make a web for the laboratory and use reaction type web for the mobile application. 

\maketitle{\textit{Programming Language}}
Additionally, we will use html and css to make web page’s basic and style, and decorate the web page using javascript (javascript 1.8.5), bootstrap and jQuery (jQuery 3.3.1). In the back-end, we will use the PHP with Laravel framework and MySQL to implement the database. 


\begin{supertabular}{ |p{2cm}|p{5cm}|  }
 \hline
 \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Tools} \\
 \hline
 Cordova Adobe Phonegap& In order to develop the hybrid application, we decided to use Cordova Adobe Phonegap. PhoneGap is the original and most popular distribution of Apache Cordova. It will allow us to turn HTML, CSS and JavaScript into an app on our own device in minutes using the simple desktop and developer apps.With this tool, there is no need to handle android. \\
 \hline
 Kakao Oven& In addition, we decided to use Kakao oven. This is used as a prototyping tool in the phase of making layout and designing UI in the front page. Each team member is going to communicate through this tool. The team member who took the responsibility of designer will mainly use this tool. Designer makes prototype which designates the overall structure, location and function of buttons, relationship between pages. Kakao oven provides the function of real web testing so that team members can simulate using the pages. The team members who are responsible for developing construct the front and back end based on the Kakao oven prototype.  \\
 \hline

 Bitbucket & For version control system, we are going to use bitbucket. Its service is free to the team which its number of members are less than 5.\\
 \hline
 Overleaf & For writing the latex IEEE report, our team decided to use Overleaf.  Overleaf (previously WriteLaTeX) is an online LaTeX and Rich Text collaborative writing and publishing tool that makes the whole process of writing, editing and publishing scientific documents much quicker and easier.
Created with the goal of making science and research faster, more open and more accessible, Overleaf brings the whole scientific documentation process into one place, from idea to writing to review to publication.
Overleaf community offers diverse templates which are very fundamental and powerful. Not only IEEE templates are included, but also other area like book publishing, assignment report, regime are included.  \\
\hline
Sublimtext 3 & This editor offers minimap. It’s useful to get an impression of how large your file is and also shows you current position while moving the scroll bar. You can even click right into the map to navigate to a certain place. It’s a little detail that really comes in handy especially for larger files.  And A Multiple Pane feature which I most commonly used when developing in project. I was able to work with many files at the same time, so the work efficiency was very good. Multiple Pane layouts are not fixed, allowing multiple layouts to be used without problems even when multiple windows are floated.\\
\hline
Chrome DevTools &Google Developers provides features optimized for front-end work. You can see the modified codes on the screen immediately applied. There are many cases where the margin or position does not match due to the nature of the front end. Also, if there is an error or unapplied css or javascript file I can easily find out which class and which file does not apply. Debugging is really simple. So I wrote the code in developer mode and proceed to copy in sublime text 3.\\
\hline
Phpstorm & PhpStorm is an innovative, Java-based integrated development environment (IDE) engineered by JetBrains for PHP and web developers. The software leverages IntelliJ IDEA to enable developers to write code in multiple languages including CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, and Emmet. It is a sized down version of IntelliJ that comes with the added advantage of fully-fledged PHP support. PhpStorm optimizes topnotch coding assistance, in-depth code understanding, and support for major IDE frameworks and PHP tools.\\
\hline
Laravel & Laravel is a prominent member of a new generation of web frameworks. It is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell back in 2011 and intended for the development of web applications following the MVC model.It features modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager.
It provides different ways for accessing relational databases though Routing.
There are utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance.It aims at easy authentication by providing a simple and easy to use interface and many more.\\

\subsubsection{Purpose}

\subsubsection{functionality}
Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern and based on Symfony. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar

\subsubsection{Location of Source Code}

Functions in Experiment Result Controller

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height = 3.75cm]{class/f1.png}
\end{center}
construct(): The functions in the Controller are available only when current user is admin.
create(): Bring up a page to save the experiment results. Using id value get by Request, hand over the subject's data corresponding to the experiment results. It passes on information on which of the Experimental-Detail Models you have experimented. And when the Create Results page is returned, the data is handed over together.
show(): Upload the page where the subject's experiment results are stored. Check the subject model with the parameter id value. Hand over the User information corresponding to the Participant. The results of the same kind of experiment that the subjects participated are inquired with the parameter id.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height = 4cm]{class/f2.png}
\end{center}
store(): Store the Experiment data of the subject. Store the information received in the Post method per column in the new Experimental Result Object. The status of the subject changes from To be Metermed (TDB) to Completed (CW) when the experiment results for that subject are saved. Save the test result file if it exists. Check if a folder with that name exists within the Public folder, and if not, create the folder with MakeDirectory method of File.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height = 3.75cm]{class/f3.png}
\end{center}
delete(): Delete the experiment results whose status column is CW from the subject's table. Store and inquire the subject id of the experiment result to be deleted. It only deletes the contents of the table. So, after receiving the address of the "file" column of the table, use the delete method of the file to go to the actual address of the file and delete the file. Among the experimental-result data, the subject id column finds a model that is equal to the value of i and erases the data from the table. When all deletion is complete, return response.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height = 5.25cm]{class/f4.png}
\end{center}
delete-user(): Used to delete a candidate from the list of candidates to be tested. Check the applicant who applied for the test notice with the parameter id. Delete the candidate corresponding to the id value from the Participant table. The number of applying persons in the application column in the test announcement table is reduced by 1 because the applicants for the experiment were deleted. When all deletion is complete, return response.
download(): Download the experiment result file. Grant permission to access to account ‘admin’. Check the experimental-result data corresponding to the id. The actual file path value saved in the file column of the retrieved data is given. Return response by putting a file path value in the Download() method.
